## Understanding Formats

- **Battle Style**: Classic 1v1 Pokemon battles
- **Lead Pokemon**: 1 Pokemon leads the battle

Singles format is great for:

- Testing individual Pokemon strength
- Traditional Pokemon battle experience

### Doubles (2v2)

- **Team Size**: Select 4-6 Pokemon
- **Battle Style**: VGC-style 2v2 battles
- **Lead Pokemon**: 2 Pokemon lead the battle at once
- **Strategy**: Team synergy and support moves are crucial

Doubles format is great for:

Each format has separate rankings, so you can compete in both!

- After 30 seconds, the range expands gradually
- You can leave the queue anytime by clicking "Leave Queue"

## Battle Rules

### Level Adjustment

By default, all Pokemon are set to **Level 70** during ranked battles. This ensures fair competition regardless of training level. Your Pokemon return to their original level after the battle.

### Turn Timer

Each turn has a **30-second timer**. If you don't make a move in time:
- You'll receive a warning
- After 5 warnings, you'll forfeit the match
- Plan your moves quickly but carefully!

### Banned Items, Pokemon, and Moves

Each format (Singles and Doubles) has its own banlist. Common bans include:

**Typically Banned Pokemon:**
- Uber-tier legendaries (Mewtwo, Rayquaza, etc.)
- Mythical Pokemon (depending on server rules)
- Some overpowered Pokemon (check the in-game blacklist GUI)

**Commonly Banned Moves:**
- OHKO moves (Fissure, Sheer Cold, etc.)
- Evasion moves (Double Team, Minimize)
- Some problematic moves (Baton Pass, Last Respects)

**Commonly Banned Abilities:**
- Moody
- Shadow Tag
- Arena Trap

**Commonly Banned Items:**
- Bright Powder
- Lax Incense

Check the blacklist GUI in `/ranked` to see exactly what's banned on your server!

### What Happens If You Disconnect?

If you disconnect during a battle:
- You'll receive a "flee penalty"
- Your flee count increases by 1
- Penalties increase with each disconnect:
  - 1-5 flees: 5 minute queue ban
  - 6-10 flees: 15 minute queue ban
  - 11+ flees: 30 minute queue ban
- Flee count decreases by 1 every 24 hours (if enabled)
- You'll lose Elo as if you forfeited

**Avoid disconnecting!** Always try to finish your battles fairly.

## The Elo System

### What is Elo?

Elo is a rating system that measures your skill level. When you win, your Elo goes up. When you lose, it goes down. The system tries to match you with players of similar skill.

### Default System: Pokemon Showdown

By default, CobbleRanked uses the same Elo system as Pokemon Showdown:

- **Starting Elo**: 1000
- **Minimum Elo**: 1000 (you can't drop below this)
- **Elo Change**: Based on opponent's rating
  - Beating higher-rated opponents = more Elo gained
  - Beating lower-rated opponents = less Elo gained
  - Losing to higher-rated opponents = less Elo lost
  - Losing to lower-rated opponents = more Elo lost

### Elo Tiers (Approximate)

| Elo Range | Skill Level |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1000-1199 | Beginner |
| 1200-1499 | Intermediate |
| 1500-1799 | Advanced |
| 1800-2099 | Expert |
| 2100+ | Master |

### Inactive Decay

If you don't play for a while, your Elo may slowly decrease. This encourages active participation and ensures the leaderboards stay current.

- **Decay Rate**: 2 Elo per day of inactivity (default)
- **When It Runs**: 9 AM UTC daily
- **Purpose**: Keep rankings accurate for active players

### Daily Elo Gain Limit

Some servers limit how much Elo you can gain per day to prevent grinding. Check with your server admin if this is enabled.

## Seasons

### What are Seasons?

Seasons are competitive periods (typically 30 days) where you compete for leaderboard rankings. At the end of each season:

- Top players receive special rewards
- A new season begins (automatic rotation)
- Your Elo may reset (depending on server settings)

### Season Information

Check the current season with `/season`:

- **Season Name**: e.g., "Season 1"
- **Status**: Active or Ended
- **Time Remaining**: Days/hours until season ends
- **Leaderboard**: Your current rank

### End-of-Season Rewards

Top players in each format receive exclusive rewards:

**Example Rewards (may vary by server):**

**Singles:**
- 1st Place: 64x Diamond, 1000 coins, "Legend" title
- 2nd-3rd Place: 32x Gold, 500 coins, "Master" title
- 4th-10th Place: 16x Iron, 200 coins, "Elite" title
- 11th-25th Place: 32x Emerald, 100 coins

**Doubles:**
- Similar reward structure for Doubles format

Rewards are typically given as commands that grant you items, currency, and titles automatically!
