Prove your skills in competitive Pokemon battles. Climb the leaderboard, earn your rank, and become the champion.

## The Thrill of Competition

Every ranked battle matters. Beat stronger opponents for massive ELO gains. Take down rivals and watch your name rise on the leaderboard. This is where legends are made.

**Win** and your rating climbs. **Lose** and you'll need to fight your way back. Simple rules, endless competition.

## How to Play

1. Open the ranked menu with `/ranked`
2. Choose your format — Singles, Doubles, or Triples
3. Click **Join Queue**
4. Wait for matchmaking to find a worthy opponent
5. Accept the match and prepare for battle
6. Fight, win, and claim your glory

## Battle Flow

```
Join Queue → Match Found → Ready Check → Team Selection → Lead Selection → Battle → Results
```

### Ready Check

Both players must confirm they're ready. If you don't respond in time, the match is canceled and you'll face a cooldown penalty.

### Team Selection

Choose which Pokemon from your party will fight. You have 90 seconds to make your selection — choose wisely.

### Lead Selection

Pick your opening Pokemon. Your opponent won't see your choice until the battle begins. Mind games start here.

## Smart Matchmaking

CobbleRanked finds fair matches based on your skill:

- **Initial search**: ±100 ELO range
- **As time passes**: Range automatically expands
- **Maximum range**: Capped to prevent unfair matches

## The Stakes

### Disconnecting

Disconnect during battle? Automatic loss. Your ELO drops and you may face a temporary queue ban. Don't risk it.

### Declining Matches

Decline a ready check? You'll need to wait before queuing again. Repeated offenses mean longer cooldowns.

## Queue Restrictions

While queued, you can't access PC, use certain items, teleport, or start other battles. Stay focused on the upcoming fight.

## Get Started

```

Open the GUI to view your stats, check the leaderboard, and jump into queue.
