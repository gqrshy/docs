## Troubleshooting

**Can't queue for Multi?**
- Verify party formed (2 players)
- Both players must have enough Pokemon
- Check both selected same format

**Stats not tracking correctly?**
- Verify playing correct format
- Check format in leaderboard
- Stats are format-independent

**Matchmaking slow for specific format?**
- Doubles/Multi have smaller player pools
- See [Dynamic Matchmaking](dynamic-matchmaking.md)
