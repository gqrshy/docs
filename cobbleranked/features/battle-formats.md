## Singles Format

### Overview

**Format:** 1v1
**Active Pokemon:** 1 per side
**Team size:** 6 Pokemon
**Showdown format:** `GEN_9_SINGLES`

The classic Pokemon battle format where one Pokemon from each side is active at a time.

### How Singles Works

1. **Select lead Pokemon** at battle start
2. **One Pokemon active** per side
3. **Switch freely** (following standard battle rules)
4. **First to defeat** all opponent Pokemon wins

### Strategy

**Singles emphasizes:**
- **Individual Pokemon strength** - Each Pokemon must hold its own
- **Type coverage** - Need answers to many threats
- **Momentum control** - Switching vs staying in
- **Prediction** - Anticipating opponent switches

**Common archetypes:**
- **Balanced** - Mix of offense, defense, utility
- **Hyper Offense** - Fast, hard-hitting sweepers
- **Stall** - Defensive walls, recovery, status
- **Weather teams** - Rain, Sun, Sand, Snow synergy

### Example Team Structure

```
1. Lead (usually fast or bulky setup)
2. Physical Attacker
3. Special Attacker
4. Defensive Wall
5. Support/Utility
6. Late-game Sweeper
```

## Doubles Format

### Overview

**Format:** 2v2
**Active Pokemon:** 2 per side
**Team size:** 6 Pokemon
**Showdown format:** `GEN_9_DOUBLES`

Similar to VGC (Video Game Championships) format where two Pokemon are active per side.

### How Doubles Works

1. **Select lead pair** (2 Pokemon) at battle start
2. **Two Pokemon active** per side
3. **Target selection** - Choose which opponent to attack
4. **Switch either Pokemon** freely
5. **First to defeat** all opponent Pokemon wins

### Strategy

**Doubles emphasizes:**
- **Team synergy** - Pokemon must work together
- **Spread moves** - Attacks hitting both opponents (Earthquake, Dazzling Gleam)
- **Redirection** - Follow Me, Rage Powder, Storm Drain
- **Speed control** - Tailwind, Trick Room, Icy Wind
- **Protect usage** - Essential for surviving focused attacks

**Common strategies:**
- **Trick Room** - Slow, powerful Pokemon dominate
- **Tailwind** - Speed boost for 4 turns
- **Weather + Abusers** - Rain + Swift Swim, etc.
- **Redirection + Setup** - Protect partner while setting up

### Example Team Structure

```
1. Fast Support (Tailwind, Fake Out)
2. Primary Attacker
3. Secondary Attacker
4. Defensive Support (Redirection)
5. Weather Setter
6. Trick Room Attacker
```
