# Ranked Battles

Learn how ranked battles work in CobbleRanked.

## Overview

Ranked battles are competitive Pokemon battles where players compete for Elo rating and leaderboard positions. CobbleRanked manages the entire battle flow from queue to results.

## Battle Flow

### 1. Queue Phase

**Player joins queue:**
1. Opens ranked GUI (`/ranked`)
2. Selects battle format (Singles or Doubles)
3. Clicks queue button
4. Enters matchmaking pool

**Queue status:**
- In queue: Searching for opponent
- Wait time displayed
- Can leave queue anytime

### 2. Matchmaking

**Automated pairing:**
- Players matched by Elo range
- Same battle format required
- Range expands over time if no match found

**Matchmaking criteria:**
1. **Same format:** Both players queued for same format (Singles or Doubles)
2. **Elo range:** Within configured range (default ±200, expands over time)
3. **Valid party:** Both players have valid Pokemon teams

**Example:**
```
Player A: 1000 Elo, Singles queue
Player B: 1050 Elo, Singles queue
Result: Match found! (within 200 Elo range)
```

### 3. Pre-Battle Validation

Before battle starts, both teams are validated:

**Validation checks:**
- ✅ Team size matches requirements (default: 6)
- ✅ No banned Pokemon (blacklist)
- ✅ No banned moves
- ✅ No banned abilities
- ✅ No banned items
- ✅ Special format requirements (if enabled)

**If validation fails:**
- Player removed from queue
- Error message displayed with reason
- Other player returns to queue

### 4. Teleportation

**Arena selection:**
1. Random arena selected from configuration
2. Both players teleport simultaneously
3. Previous location saved for return

**Teleport features:**
- Works across dimensions (Overworld, Nether, End, custom)
- Preserves inventory and effects
- Instant teleportation (no loading screen)

### 5. Battle Start

**Battle initialization:**
1. Players face each other
2. Battle GUI appears

### 7. Battle End

### 8. Results Processing

**After battle ends:**

1. **Elo calculation:**
   - Winner gains Elo
   - Loser loses Elo
   - Amount based on Elo system configuration

2. **Stats update:**
   - Wins/losses incremented
   - Win rate recalculated
   - Flee count updated (if disconnect)
   - Format-specific stats updated

3. **Database save:**
   - Player stats persisted
   - Battle history recorded
   - Leaderboard updated

4. **Return teleport:**
   - Players return to previous location
   - Inventory restored
   - Effects preserved

### 9. Rewards

**Post-battle rewards:**

**Milestone rewards** (if configured):
- 10 wins
- 25 wins
- 50 wins
- 100 wins

**Notification:**
Players receive messages about:
- Elo change
- New rank position
- Milestone rewards (if unlocked)

## Battle Formats

CobbleRanked supports three battle formats with independent rankings:

### Singles (1v1)

**Format:** `GEN_9_SINGLES`
- One Pokemon active per side
- Classic 1v1 battle
- Most common competitive format

**Team requirements:**
- 6 Pokemon in party
- Lead Pokemon selection

### Doubles (2v2)

**Format:** `GEN_9_DOUBLES`
- Two Pokemon active per side
- Similar to VGC official format
- More strategic depth

**Team requirements:**
- 6 Pokemon in party
- Lead pair selection

## Independent Rankings

Each format has separate:
- Elo rating
- Win/loss record
- Leaderboard position
- Statistics

**Example:**
```
Player A Stats:
  Singles: 1200 Elo, 15W-5L
  Doubles: 1000 Elo, 0W-0L (never played)
```

## Disconnect Handling

### Intentional Disconnect (Rage Quit)

**Detection:**
- Player closes game during battle
- Client disconnects from server
- No forfeit button used

**Penalty:**
- Flee count +1
- Counts as loss
- Elo penalty applied
- Opponent wins automatically

**Flee count tracking:**
- Visible in player stats
- Never decreases automatically
- Admin can reset: `/rankedarena flee reset <player>`

### Unintentional Disconnect (Crash/Internet)

**Same penalty:**
- CobbleRanked cannot distinguish intentional vs unintentional
- All disconnects treated the same
- Prevents abuse

**Protection:**
- Admin can manually reset flee count for legitimate crashes
- Elo can be manually adjusted: `/rankedarena elo add <player> <amount>`

### Connection Issues

**Before battle starts:**
- Player removed from queue
- No penalty
- Can rejoin queue

**During battle:**
- Treated as disconnect
- Flee count incremented
- Opponent wins

## Draw Conditions

### Turn Limit Reached

**Trigger:** Battle reaches max turns (default: 100)

**Result:**
- Battle ends in draw
- No Elo change for either player
- Does not count as win or loss
- No flee count penalty

**Configuration:**
```json5
"battle": {
  "maxTurns": 100  // Increase for longer battles
}
```

### Both Players Disconnect

**Rare scenario:** Both players disconnect simultaneously

**Result:**
- Battle canceled
- No Elo change
- No stats update
- No penalty

## Special Cases

### Invalid Team Mid-Battle

**Scenario:** Team becomes invalid during battle (e.g., banned Pokemon obtained via hack)

**Result:**
- Battle ends immediately
- Invalid team player loses
- Opponent wins
- Severe warning issued

### Arena Issues

**Scenario:** Arena world unloads or becomes invalid during battle

**Result:**
- Battle continues (battle instance is separate)
- Return teleport uses fallback location (spawn)
- Error logged for admin review

### Server Crash

**Scenario:** Server crashes during battle

**Result:**
- Battle canceled on restart
- No Elo change
- No stats update
- Players return to previous location

## Battle Statistics

### Tracked Per Format

- **Total battles:** Wins + losses
- **Win rate:** Wins / (wins + losses) * 100%
- **Current Elo:** Real-time rating
- **Peak Elo:** Highest Elo reached (future feature)
- **Flee count:** Disconnect penalties

### Global Statistics

- **Total battles:** Sum across all formats
- **Favorite format:** Most played
- **Best format:** Highest Elo
- **Overall win rate:** Combined win rate

## Competitive Features

### Level Scaling

**Force level cap:**
```json5
"battle": {
  "levelMatch": 70,        // All Pokemon become level 70
  "forceLevelCap": true    // Enforce scaling
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Fair competition
- No grinding advantage
- Skill-based battles

### Original Trainer Requirement

**Prevent traded teams:**
```json5
"competitive": {
  "requireOriginalTrainer": true  // Must be OT
}
```

**Effect:**
- Player must be original trainer of all Pokemon
- Prevents buying/trading for perfect teams
- Encourages legitimate catching/breeding

### Team Size Enforcement

**Fixed party size:**
```json5
"competitive": {
  "teamSize": 6  // Must have exactly 6 Pokemon
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Standard competitive format
- Prevents unfair advantages
- Consistent with official tournaments

## Battle Commands

### During Battle
